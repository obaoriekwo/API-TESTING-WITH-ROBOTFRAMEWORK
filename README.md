API TESTING WITH ROBOT FRAMEWORK DATA DRIVEN

This task features some HTTP request methods namely, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Libraries such as Json, collections, JSON and Requests were imported to execute the Robotframework codes. HTTP is a means of communication by web API'S. HTTP protocol follows a client server model where clients communicate with server by sending request and waiting for responses. GET request method simply requests for information to retrieve data and should not cause any data modificaton. You can retrieve employees, students etc data via GET requests. POST are used to modify or cry a new resource. It means that whenever new student or employee is hired, a POST request is used to add the employee or student to the system. PUT request method is used to modify or update an existing data instead of creating a new one. So if employees  job title or department has changed PUT will be send to make the changes. DELETE request is used to remove data from the database. So if an employee leaves a company, the delete request method will be used. This project demonstrates how the HTTP methods are used in reality using Robertframework data driven.  HTTP methods such as GET requests, DELETE requests, PUT and POST requests were used in place of  PickApple, TrashApple, IsGoodApple and AddApple respectively
